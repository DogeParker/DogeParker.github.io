        <h2>About this website...</h2>
        <div class="a">In case you couldn't already tell, this website is not in the least bit official 
            and is really more of a testing ground while I work out how html, js and css work
            (which is barely in this case). Here's where I would under normal circumstances put 
            a place to log suggestions, but php isn't a part of my workload so that really 
            isn't happening. All of the code for this website is available in the corresponding 
            github repository where this is hosted, if you want to browse. <br>Have a great day :)
